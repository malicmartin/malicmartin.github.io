Hey there! I'm Martin, originally from Slovenia. I studied law at the University of Ljubljana but had a change of heart about my career path a year before graduation.

Seeking new experiences, I moved to London where I explored various career paths. Eventually, I discovered my passion for tech and decided to pursue it wholeheartedly.

## My Journey

- **Education**: I pursued law studies at the University of Ljubljana.
- **Career Transition**: From delivering pizzas for Domino's to excelling as a sales negotiator at a prominent London estate agency, I honed my resilience and adaptability.
- **Entrepreneurial Pursuit**: With foresight of economic shifts, I embarked on a journey to acquire an estate agency, seeking opportunities for entrepreneurship and high-risk, high-reward ventures through the creation of significant value-added output. Despite relentless efforts, my quest remained elusive.
- **Tech Aspiration**: Faced with the reality of a shifting landscape, I opted to acquire crucial skills. I began with Python, initially undertaking a Cisco Networking Academy course followed by a DfE-funded bootcamp by HyperionDev.

## Projects

### Task Manager Program

### Personal Projects

- : Another work in progress is Baldur's Gate 3 tactics analyzer - a program designed to calculate the expected statistical outcomes of different tactics in Baldur's Gate 3. Its purpose is to assist the player in making the best tactical decisions during battles.
